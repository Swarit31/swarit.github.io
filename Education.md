# Education

## M.S., Mechanical Engineering (Micro and Nano Manufacturing) | University of Cincinnati (_April 2024_)
- GPA: 3.23/4.0
- Advisor: [Dr. Murali Sundaram](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vXY-oQMAAAAJ&hl=en)
- Awards: GIA Scholarship

### [Graduate Thesis]: _Photocatalyst Assisted Electrochemical Machining of Titanium_
- Developed a novel Ultraviolet-assisted electrochemical machining method for titanium. Implemented Control system using Arduino as well as design of experiments executed to achieve enhanced material removal rate, better surface finish and lower overcut.

## B.E., Mechanical Engineering | Savitrbai Phule Pune University (_May 2022_)
- First Class with Distinction
- GPA: 8.73/10
- Advisor: Dr. P.D. Patil

### [Undergraduate Thesis](https://ijcrt.org/papers/IJCRT2205752.pdf): _Testing Mechanical Properties of Human Femur Bone at Head Portion_
- Studied mechanical properties of additively manufactured femur bone implant. A 3D computed tomography scan of actual bone was performed to identify and record accurate dimension of patient's bone. Further designing and optimizations were done to the CAD model of the said bone. We analyzed mechanical properties and service life of the developed bone implant using benchmark properties of additively manufactured components as well as material properties.
